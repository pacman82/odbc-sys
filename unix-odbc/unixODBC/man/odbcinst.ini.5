.SH NAME
/etc/odbcinst.ini - An unixODBC drivers configuration

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B /etc/odbcinst.ini
is a text configuration file for unixODBC drivers. It can be edited by hand,
but the recommended way to update this file is to use the
.BR odbcinst (1)
utility.

.SH FILE FORMAT
The general .ini file format is:

.RS
.nf
.BI [ SectionName1 ]
.IB key1 " = " value1
.IB key2 " = " value2
.B ...

.BI [ SectionName2 ]
.IB key1 " = " value1
.IB key2 " = " value2
.B ...
.fi
.RE

Each ODBC driver has its own section and can be referred to by the name of its
section. Configuration keys recognised in driver sections by unixODBC itself are:

.IP \fBDescription
A text string briefly describing the driver.

.IP \fBDriver
A filesystem path to the actual driver library.

.IP \fBSetup
A filesystem path to the driver setup library.

.IP \fBFileUsage

The section named \fB[ODBC]\fR configures global options. Keys recognised in
the \fB[ODBC]\fR section include:

.IP \fBTrace\fB

Enable ODBC driver trace output, which is written to the path specified by \fBTraceFile\fR.

Note that some drivers have their own separate trace control options. Unlike
the \fBTrace\fR option these are usually specified at the DSN level.

Values recognised as enabled are any case variation of "1", "y", "yes" or "on".

.IP \fBTraceFile\fB

Path or path-pattern to write the ODBC trace file to. Has no effect unless
\fBTrace\fR is enabled. Default \fB/tmp/sql.log\fR.

\fIWARNING\fR: setting \fBTraceFile\fB to a path writeable by multiple users
may not work correctly as only the first user will be able to create and open
the file.

.SS TEMPLATE FILES
The recommended way to manage the drivers is using the
.BR odbcinst (1)
utility. You can install the drivers by supplying it with template file, which
has the same format as this file.

.SH EXAMPLES
An example of the actual PostgreSQL driver:

.RS
.nf
[PostgreSQL]
Description = PostgreSQL driver for GNU/Linux
Driver      = /usr/lib/psqlodbcw.so
Setup       = /usr/lib/libodbcpsqlS.so
FileUsage   = 1
.fi
.RE

Note that driver paths may vary, and some drivers require \fBDriver64\fR and
\fBSetup64\fR entries too.

By specifying the driver like that, you can then reference it in the
.BR odbc.ini (5)
as follows:

.RS
.nf
Driver = PostgreSQL
.fi
.RE

The recommended way to add that driver is by creating a template file containing:

.RS
.nf
[PostgreSQL]
Description = PostgreSQL driver for GNU/Linux
Driver      = /usr/lib/psqlodbcw.so
Setup       = /usr/lib/libodbcpsqlS.so
.fi
.RE

and call the 
.BR odbcinst (1):

.RS
.BI "# odbcinst -i -d -f " template.ini
.RE
